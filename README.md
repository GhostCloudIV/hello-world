Origins of Web Development

Hello World, 

I am eager, as a new software developer, to help bridge the gap between the knowledge of and the accessibility to data information, within my own community. My current interests of developing would include Javascript, C++, Data Binding, and ReactJS. I recently began coding to better challange myself and it has been an interesting and consistent oasis for learning and choosing to exceed limitations. They say that the sky is the limit, until I discovered that Mars used to be my galactic home.
